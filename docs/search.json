Through my self-portraits, I aim to capture the essence of my own being and reflect on my own journey through time. Each photograph is a reflection of my own experiences and emotions. Through my photography, I hope to offer a glimpse into my life as a scholar and adventurer, and inspire others to reflect on their own journeys through the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."

I am a research assistant in the Shoffstall Lab at Case Western Reserve University where I am investigating the vagus nerve through cadaveric dissection and MRI imaging.\nAfter graduating with bachelor’s degrees in Psychology and Integrative Biology from the University of California, Berkeley, I explored various roles to broaden my understanding of the human psyche, including teaching first-generation, low-income first graders, understanding functional human anatomy, providing behavioral and educational support in youth group interventions, and exploring the intersection of brain imaging and neuropsychological assessment in children with autism and speech disorders.\nIn my spare time, you can find me trying new sports, exploring different coffee shop ambiances, or spending time with my cats, Gattaca and Nyx.”\nPlease feel free to contact me here.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
